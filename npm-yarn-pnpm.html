        <!-- NPM Section -->
        <section class="package-manager">
            <h2>NPM (Node Package Manager)</h2>
            <p><strong>NPM is the JavaScript package manager that ships with Node.js.</strong> It allows developers to share and install dependencies in their projects, making it an essential tool for keeping libraries and packages in the JS ecosystem updated.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Locking of Package: NPM comes with a feature called <strong>package-lock.json</strong>, which ensures you install the same version of dependencies across all environments.</li>
                <li>Automatic Vulnerability Assessments: NPM scans installed packages for known vulnerabilities, making it easier for developers to keep their apps secure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Ideal Use Cases:</strong> Recommended for package management in standard mode, especially for legacy projects where simplicity and compatibility are key considerations.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Yarn Section -->
        <section class="package-manager">
            <h2>Yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)</h2>
            <p><strong>Yarn was created to address issues in NPM, such as performance and non-deterministic dependency resolution.</strong> Developed by Facebook and Google, it solves several problems that were seen as insurmountable with NPM.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Caching:</strong> Yarn caches installed dependencies, making subsequent installations faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Offline Installation:</strong> If a dependency was previously installed, Yarn allows you to install it even while offline.</li>
                <li><strong>Workspaces:</strong> Yarn supports workspaces, enabling you to manage multiple packages in one repository (ideal for monorepos).</li>
                <li><strong>Deterministic Dependency Resolution:</strong> Yarn ensures that the same versions of dependencies are installed everywhere, avoiding "dependency drift."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Ideal Use Cases:</strong> Yarn is best for faster installations, offline development, and monorepo management for projects with multiple packages.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- PNPM Section -->
        <section class="package-manager">
            <h2>PNPM (Performance NPM)</h2>
            <p><strong>PNPM is a fast, disk space-efficient package manager that enhances installation speeds (~50% faster than NPM & Yarn).</strong> It introduces a different dependency management approach that optimizes performance and disk space usage.</p>
            <p><strong>Features to Note:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Persistent Local Dependency:</strong> PNPM stores all libraries locally in one place, symlinking them to node_modules, saving both disk space and installation time.</li>
                <li><strong>Disk Space Friendly:</strong> PNPM avoids duplicating dependencies across projects, saving valuable disk space.</li>
                <li><strong>Precise Dependency Model:</strong> PNPM uses a strict dependency model to avoid issues like "dependency hell."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Large projects and monorepos, as well as scenarios requiring fast installations, disk space efficiency, and precise dependency management.</p>

        <!-- Selecting Suitable Package Software -->
        <section class="package-manager">
            <h2>Selecting Suitable Package Manager</h2>
            <p><strong>NPM:</strong> Use NPM if you need a simple, vanilla package manager for JavaScript and prioritize compatibility with the Node.js ecosystem.</p>
            <p><strong>Yarn:</strong> Choose Yarn if you need faster installation times, especially for projects with many dependencies, and offline installation capabilities. Itâ€™s also great for managing monorepos.</p>
            <p><strong>PNPM:</strong> Opt for PNPM if performance, disk space efficiency, and fast installations are crucial, especially for large-scale projects or monorepos.</p>
